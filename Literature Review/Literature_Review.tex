\chapter{Literature Review}
%\section{Aims of This Section}

%This Literature Review aims to bring together various studies, and provide an insight into the use of games for educational purposes. It also aims to critically evaluate the material for any consistencies or inconsistencies, and to hopefully provide another perspective on the field.

%\subsection{Defining Serious Games}
%In the area of gamification, various definitions of serious games are found. Most commonly, and perhaps quite broadly, the term 'serious game', is defined as, digital games used for purposes other than mere entertainment \cite{Susi2416}.  While a variety of definitions have been suggested, this dissertation will use the definition suggested by \cite{Garris2002} who saw it as "instructional games that are designed for training or to promote learning" together with "games that do not have entertainment, enjoyment or fun as their primary purpose"  \cite{MichaelChen2006}. However, it is not to say that serious games should not be entertaining, enjoyable or fun.

%\subsection{Outline of Review}
%This review will; identify the benefits of serious games, and make clear any negatives, go through examples of serious games and their approaches, including any specific game design elements implemented, and outline any techniques that seem to be of positive influence or negative influence, look into existing resources for teaching SQL and outline the trade-offs with each approach, finally bring together these ideas summarise various points.

%\section{Benefits of Serious Games}
%Today's students are brought up in the digital era. \cite{Prensky2001} refers to them as 'Digital Natives', that have experienced a new form of video game play, which brings opportunities with great potential for their learning. Thus potentially making games great learning environments within education. However, \cite{Girard2013} summarises that there is need for more empirical research to determine the effectiveness of serious games. On the other hand, \cite{Pieter2013} reports that in general, serious games are more effective than traditional teaching methods, and that more studies are required to determine the effects of various features.

%In this section, we will outline some of the empirical researches that exist on the internet.

%\section{Summary}

\section{Video Games}

%The academic study of games, ludology, is a relatively new and emerging field. As the video game revolution took off in the late 20th century, so did academic interest in games. 

%Video games for entertainment have dominated the market, 

%The academic study of games, is a relatively new and emerging field. Games are naturally creative things, however academics see the potential in games for a variety of different reasons, and so game design frameworks have been developed to help design and create games.

The video games industry is growing very rapidly. The value of the video games market was predicted at \$108 billion USD in 2017, and is expected to reach \$180 billion by 2022 \cite{MarketResearchPaper, MarketResearch}.

\subsection{History}

The interest in video games 

%Many attempts to pinpoint the creation of the very first video game have been made. However, the creation of the first modern video game is commonly dated to 1958. first video game ever invented was developed by a physicist William Higinbotham, in 1958. The game was called 'Tennis for Two'. The design and concept was conjured up from an instructional book the inventor was reading at the time \cite{TennisForTwo}.

%The first recorded video game invented, was developed by a physicist called William Higinbotham, called 'Tennis for Two' in 1958. The concept of the game, came from an instructional book that he was reading at that time \cite{TennisForTwo}.

%In 1970, R. Barton discusses the evolution of 'The Imaginit Management Game' and the development of a game model. This model consisted of a set of rules, such that a management game could be repurposed to fit another management scenario \cite{Barton1970}.

%First a set of generality aspirations were defined, and then a set of strategies 'describes features of "generalized" management computer game and then reports a case history of adapting this game model, which was designed for ideal generality, to an application that challenged that very generality.

\section{Educational Games}

\subsubsection*{Instructional Games} %get rid of these when finished

An instructional game is defined as "a type of software function designed to increase motivation by adding game-like rules and/or competition to a learning activity" \cite{Roblyer2013}.

However, \citeauthor{AtsusiHirumi2010}, define an instructional game as "an interactive, digital game (e.g., adventure, strategy, role-play, action, and massive multiplayer online games) that is designed specifically to facilitate learning" \cite{AtsusiHirumi2010}.

%\citeauthor{Hays2005} defined instructional games , instruction must be designed to support specific instructional objectives, which are determined by job requirements. Second, instruction must include the opportunity for a learner to interact with the instructional content in a meaningful way. Third, the student's performance must be assessed to determine if he or she has learned what was intended. Finally, the results of the assessment must be presented to the student in a relevant and timely manner to either reinforce correct actions or to provide remediation for incorrect actions.

\subsubsection*{Serious Games} %get rid of these when finished

There are many definitions for the term 'Serious Game', but most agree on a core meaning that serious games are (digital) games used for purposes other than mere entertainment \cite{Susi2416}. \citeauthor{Zyda2005}, defined them as "a mental contest, played with a computer in accordance with specific rules, that uses entertainment to further government or corporate training, education, health, public policy, and strategic communication objectives" \cite{Zyda2005}.
%So for the purpose of this dissertation, we will focus on the subset of serious games that are concerned with educational purposes.

%Video games for entertainment purposes have dominated the market, however serious games are expected to grow. Serious games have proved to be successful, however further research is required to determine the effectiveness of such games \cite{Susi2416}.

This dissertation aims to create a game for learning in educational contexts. Thus this game fits all the above definitions.

\subsection{Engagement}

The design and production of video games involves aspects of cognitive psychology, computer science, environmental design, and storytelling, to name a few \cite{Koster2004}.

\subsection{Examples}

(Not my words) Robocode (2001) is one of the first environments developed as an open source educational game in order to support java programming

\section{Educational Game Design}

Designing educational games requires a focus that is different from general game design; otherwise, we may end up designing fun games with little or no learning value \cite{Barnes2007}.

\citeauthor{Driskell2002} describes a "tacit model that is inherent in most studies of instructional games". The model is as follows. Initially, we define a set of learning outcomes and objectives that we wish to achieve. We then design an instructional program which incorporates certain characteristics of games, that delivers the desired learning objectives. Subsequently, the program triggers a cycle that includes user judgments, user behaviours and system feedback. If the pairing of the instructional content with the appropriate game features is successful and effective, the cycle achieves recurring and self-motivated game play. Finally, this engagement in the game leads to the achievement of the learning outcomes \cite{Driskell2002}. This model is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Input_process_outcome_game_model}.

\subsection{Features}

(CHANGE IT UP) \citeauthor{Barnes2007} ran a project that made University Students create games that would teach basic programming. They carried out evaluations to test participant learning from the game, and made some interesting observations as follows: Clear instructions and game goals must be provided and accessible throughout the game, Learning goals must be clearly tied to in-game feedback that motivates the player (through, e.g. experience points, health), and penalizes guessing, Humor can be a motivation for in-game interaction \cite{Barnes2007}.
